# Weekly Creative Professional Wellness Guide

A gentle reminder that you're a talented creative who deserves good things. Here's a structure for those weeks when you need a little extra support.

## Monday - Knowledge Sharing Day
*Because starting the week by helping others helps us too*
- Pick one small technical thing you learned recently
- Write a quick tutorial or thread about it
- Share it somewhere (Twitter, Blog, Discord)
- Remember: Teaching solidifies our own understanding

## Tuesday - Portfolio Love Day
*Because sometimes we forget how far we've come*
- Pick one old project you're proud of
- Write better documentation for it
- Add some progress shots or behind-the-scenes notes
- Upload that shader experiment you thought wasn't "ready"
- Remember: Perfection is the enemy of progress

## Wednesday - Community Connection Day
*Because midweek is perfect for human connection*
- Join one new Discord server in your interest area
- Respond thoughtfully to someone else's question
- Share something you're working on, even if it's not finished
- Remember: Other creators understand the journey

## Thursday - Learning Adventure Day
*Because growth feels good*
- Pick one small technique you've wanted to learn
- Spend just 25 minutes exploring it
- Document what you learned, even if it's just bullet points
- Remember: Small steps lead to big journeys

## Friday - Creation Day
*Because making something new lifts the spirit*
- Start a tiny project (emphasis on tiny!)
- Focus on play and experimentation, not perfection
- Try combining two techniques you enjoy
- Remember: Creating is healing

## Saturday - Inspiration Day
*Because input feeds output*
- Find three pieces of work that inspire you
- Write down specifically what you like about each
- Save them in an inspiration folder
- Remember: Admiring others' work isn't comparing yourself to them

## Sunday - Reflection & Rest Day
*Because you deserve rest and recognition*
- Write down three things you did this week, no matter how small
- Plan one small goal for next week
- Organize your workspace a little
- Remember: Rest is part of the creative process

## Emergency Pick-Me-Ups
When you need an immediate boost:
- Open your old projects folder and look at past wins
- Write out a list of technical things you know now that amazed you when you first learned them
- Share a struggle in a supportive Discord - other creators understand
- Do the smallest possible creative task - even opening your IDE counts
- Remember that your career and creative journey is your own unique path

Remember: Your worth isn't measured by your productivity. You're a creative soul doing challenging technical work - that's already amazing. Be as kind to yourself as you would be to another creator sharing your struggles. ðŸ’œ
